## Niveditta in a Nutshell

I’m a dentist by education and a data analyst by profession — a unique blend that has sharpened both my technical and interpersonal skills.

Over the past two years, I worked as a data analyst, where I turned raw numbers into actionable business insights. I’ve built dashboards, cleaned messy datasets, worked with SQL, Excel, and Python, and collaborated with stakeholders to solve real problems. 

Before that, my clinical background taught me attention to detail, empathy, and how to make decisions that matter — qualities I now apply in data storytelling, problem-solving, and project delivery.

Whether it's exploring customer behavior, predicting outcomes, or building interactive dashboards, I’m always looking to simplify complexity and create impact.

Outside of work, I enjoy building side projects and learning from the global data community. I'm always curious, always growing.
